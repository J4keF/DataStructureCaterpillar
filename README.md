# DataStructureCaterpillar

The logic for a 2D caterpillar simulation employing self-implemented data structures like doubly linked lists, stacks, and queues for position and size data management, enabling caterpillar movement and food consumption functionalities.

Done as part of the 2023 Winter Semester COMP250 course @ McGill Univerity.

CaterpillarGame.java and CaterpillarDrawer.java were provided by course instructors and, when run, will display a JFrame GUI to visualize the caterpillar movement.
